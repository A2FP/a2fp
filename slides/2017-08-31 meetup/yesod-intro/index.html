# Why should you care?

Haskell web apps are
- fast
- fast to write
- easy to package in a single binary, deployment can be rsync
- fun

HOWEVER
- fair bit of ecosystem fragmentation

---

# Mindset

Typical Haskell library:

- Attoparsec:
  - parse text precisely and fast.
- Conduit:
  - handle streaming data
- async:
  - manage concurrent processes


Do one thing extremely well

---

# Web apps


... not that

- routing
- http methods, error handling etc
- database integration, migrations etc
- content-types
- authorisation
- authentication
- logging
- ...

# Why was Rails such a roaring success?

.zoomed[![yesod](rails-logo.svg "yesod")]

## convention and context
- code layout
- migrations
- golden set of defaults

???

really want to do this all yourself for every app?

---

# Ecosystem

- Snap
- Scotty/Spock/etc
- wai
- Servant
- Yesod

---

# Snap

- a collection of "snappable" modules
- i haven't built anything serious in it, can't be that objective.

---

# Scotty/Spock

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}
import Web.Scotty

import Data.Monoid (mconcat)

main = scotty 3000 $ do
    get "/:word" $ do
        beam <- param "word"
        html $ mconcat ["<h1>Scotty, ", beam, " me up!</h1>"]
```

- route-first style
- great for small apps

---
# WAI

```haskell
main = run 3000 $ \_ ->
    return $ responseLBS
        statusOK
        [("Content-Type", "text/plain")]
        "Hello World"
```

Useful mostly for cheating on benchmarks.

---

# Servant (my forbidden love)

```haskell
data User = User { userName :: Text
                 , userNobelPrizes :: Int
                 }

type UserAPI1 = "users" :> Get '[JSON] [User]

server1 :: Server UserAPI1
server1 = return [ User "Mark Wotton"     0
                 , User "Albert Einstein" 1
                 , User "Marie Curie"     2 ]

main = run 8081 $ serve (Proxy :: Proxy UserAPI1) server1

-- in client code

getUsers = client (Proxy :: UserAPI1)
```
---

## Downsides

.zoomed[![heartbreak](heartbreak.jpg "heartbreak")]
- sometimes underbaked or missing - authentication is new & fiddly, can't do some "normal" web things like set cookies
- backwards compatibility not a priority - aiming for perfection
- better for JSON-based API servers than HTML webapps

---

# Yesod

.zoomed[![yesod](yesod.png "yesod")]

- means "Foundation"
- opinionated: while you can swap pieces out, there's definitely a Yesod Way
- feature-complete
- mostly typesafe, but only to level of links (a given handler can
  render json/html/whatever any way it likes - no equivalent of
  api-as-a-type)
- bakes in support for environments (dev, test, staging, production)

---

# Yesod <3 Quasiquoters

- a way of constructing a program by running some code at compile time
- how is this different to Template Haskell?
- isn't really, just prettier.

```haskell
curryN :: Int -> Q Exp
curryN n = do
  f  <- newName "f"
  xs <- replicateM n (newName "x")
  let args = map VarP (f:xs)
      ntup = TupE (map VarE xs)
  return $ LamE args (AppE (VarE f) ntup)
```

vs

```haskell
[parseRoutes|
/             HomeR     GET
/blog         BlogR     GET POST
/blog/#BlogId BlogPostR GET POST

/static       StaticR   Static getStatic
|]
```
---
# Why go to the effort?

- DB dsl gives us migrations (sorta) as well as consistency
- dev experience is smooth: add a new field or table, the type system tells you what's on your to-do list
- link construction is typesafe, and orthogonal to actual URL structure
- so are templates!
- so is config!

General pattern: do as much at compile time as possible. Catch errors
early. Don't get paged.

---
# Quasiquoted Database DSL

```haskell
[persistLowerCase|
User json sql=users
  name        Text
  nobelPrizes Int
  uuid        UUID sqltype=uuid default=uuid_generate_v4()
  UniqUserUuid uuid
  deriving Show Read Eq Typeable
|]
```

---
# Quasiquoted Routes DSL
```haskell
[parseRoutes|
/users      UsersR    GET POST
|]
```

---
# Quasiquoted Template DSL
```haskell
$doctype 5
<html>
    <head>
        <title>#{pageTitle} - My Site
        <link rel=stylesheet href=@{Stylesheet}>
    <body>
        <h1 .page-title>#{pageTitle}
        <p>Here is a list of your friends:
        $if null friends
            <p>Sorry, I lied, you don't have any friends.
        $else
            <ul>
                $forall Friend name age <- friends
                    <li>#{name} (#{age} years old)
        <footer>^{copyright}
```

similar for CSS & JavaScript

# Databases

Yesod uses Persistent
- table layout DSL we just saw
- fairly primitive query language (sub-SQL)
- Esqueleto fills the gaps
  - maps more or less directly to SQL, can name fragments, _mostly_ typesafe

---

# Important typeclasses

Normal Haskell ecosystem
- Aeson FromJSON/ToJSON

Yesod ecosystem
- PathPiece
- Persistent

---

# Aeson

```haskell
class ToJSON a where
    toJSON     :: a -> Value

class FromJSON a where
    parseJSON  :: Value -> Parser a
```

---
# PathPiece

```haskell
class PathPiece s where
  fromPathPiece :: Text -> Maybe s
  toPathPiece :: s -> Text
```

- Basically a Read typeclass that doesn't suck. (Death to partial
functions.)
- used for parsing URLs: if you want to enforce the constraint that only
  prime-valued ids are legitimate URLs, you can do that.

---
# Persistent

```haskell
instance PersistField CustomerId where
  toPersistValue (CustomerId custId) = PersistText custId
  fromPersistValue (PersistText t) = Right (CustomerId t)
  fromPersistValue nope = Left ("Got the wrong type for CustomerId, expected PersistText, got this instead: " <> tshow nope)
```

---
# An actual handler

```haskell
getCompanyR :: Handler TypedContent
getCompanyR = do
  (_, _, company) <- requireManager
  selectRep $ do
    provideRep $ return (toJSON $ entityVal company)
    provideRep $ defaultLayout [whamlet| #{show company} |]
```

---
# what sucks

- migrations aren't reified
  - ended up using activerecord migrations & a test step that breaks the build if there are any migration changes
- compile times can be slow
- dynamic subdomained sites are a bit of a hack - have to rewrite in middleware
- no end-to-end json model by default for SPAs
  - purescript-bridge
  - ghcjs

---
# what's awesome

- most stuff is there and works
- responsive dev team
- story for integration testing (yesod-test)
- support for streaming responses without storing in-memory
