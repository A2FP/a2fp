## A2FP

### Ann Arbor Functional Programming User Group

We are a group of people in Ann Arbor, MI, interested in Functional Programming. We're interested in heaps of languages like Haskell, Scala, F#, Erlang, LISP, Ocaml, Scheme, and more.

Anyone who is interested is welcome to come along, meetings are usually the last Wednesday of the month and are announced on [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/AnnArborFP/). Attendees should RSVP.

We also have a [Google group](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/a2fp) for further discussions.



## Proposals

Talk proposals should be created as github issues in [this](https://github.com/A2FP/a2fp/issues) repo.

Proposals should:
* include a **title** and a **short description** of the talk
* be assigned to the proposed speaker
* tagged with the `proposal` label
